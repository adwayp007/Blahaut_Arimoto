## Introduction

The Blahut-Arimoto algorithm is a numerical method for computing the channel capacity of a discrete memoryless channel. This algorithm provides a practical approach to finding the capacity of a communication channel, considering both input and output alphabets.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `blahut_arimoto.py`: Python script containing the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm implementation.
- `blahut_arimoto.m`: MATLAB script with an alternative implementation of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm.
- Other utility files: Supporting files and functions for testing and visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blahut-arimoto.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd blahut-arimoto
